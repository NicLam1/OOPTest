- **Automatic Background Removal:** Uses background removal algorithm in Java to isolate the subject
- **Manual Cropping & Resizing:** Manually crop photos and automatically resize them to meet official ID photo dimensions
- **High-Resolution Export:** Save processed ID photos in high quality (PNG or JPEG)
- **International Format Support:** Select from globally recognized ID photo sizes:
  - 35x45 mm (UK, Europe, Australia, Singapore, Nigeria)
  - 2x2 inches (US and India)
  - 5x7 cm (Canada)
  - 33x48 mm (China)

### üé® Photo Enhancement & Editing

- **Adjust Brightness, Contrast, Saturation:** Fine-tune the visual quality of your photo
- **Real-Time Image Preview:** View edits live before proceeding to the next step
- **Custom Filename and Export Format:** Define image file names and choose between PNG or JPEG

### üìè Size, Layout, and Background Options

- **Background Replacement:** Choose from preset solid colors (e.g., white, blue) or upload your own background image
- **Custom Cropping Alignment:** Adjust photo alignment to ensure correct face positioning and spacing
- **Face Centering Support:** Provides visual guidance to align faces according to international standards
- **DPI-Compliant Output:** Generates photos at the appropriate DPI for printing or digital submission

## Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- Node.js 14 or higher
- NPM 6 or higher

## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Important:** Add the ONNX model file to the `backend/models` directory:

   - You will need to obtain the ONNX model file separately
   - Ensure the model is compatible with the application

3. Build the application:

   ```
   mvn clean package
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

5. Run the backend server:
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   The server will start at http://localhost:8080

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the application:

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the ONNX model, try changing the ONNX runtime version in the `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.onnxruntime</groupId>
    <artifactId>onnxruntime</artifactId>
    <version>1.20.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Change the version to `1.21.0` and rebuild:

```
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Architecture

- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot application handling image processing with OpenCV and AI-based background removal
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS application with a step-by-step UI process for photo editing
